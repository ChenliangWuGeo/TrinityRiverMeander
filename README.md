# TrinityRiverMeander
Simulation for meandering patterns for the Trinity River, TX. This is a implementation of the methods from Ikeda et al. (1989) and Sun et al. (1996).

The two scripts "progradationCase.m" and "EGradient.m" can simulate Trinity River planform patterns under the cases of 1. delta progradation and 2. spatial gradient in bank erosion coefficient respectively. The results are saved in two corresponding files: "progradationCaseResults.mat" and "EGradientResults.mat".

"TrinityBW.m" simulates progradation of the trinity river with the simulated shoreline location saved as "STF.mat".

Run the script "plotFig" will provide the results of the simulation.
